            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>Python was the first language we learned about in DIT.</p>
            <p>Python is an object oriented programming language that allows us to make quick
            and easy console based applications. These console application can perform tasks
            such as calculation, age verification, and even rudimentary games! This functionality
            can be improved via packages called libraries, these can allow Python to do more
            advanced things such as interfacing with API's</p>
            <h3>Searching and sorting</h3>
            <p>Searching and sorting was the second topic we learnt about in DIT.</p>
            <p>Searching and sorting algorithms allow us to easily find specific data amongst
            large data sets such as password and username data bases found in big companies like
            Google and Facebook.</p>
            <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p>HTML and CSS are what this website is made out of.</p>
            <p>HTML and CSS are important as they allow for websites to be made. HTML is a
            markup language and CSS is used to style HTML. HTML stand for hyper text markup
            language and CSS stands for cascading stylesheets.</p>
